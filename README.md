Just Practice about the tkinter (pack,grid,place).
-------------
1. pack
+ Can use pady to set "top" , "left" , "right" , "bottom".
-------------
2. grid
+ Can use olumn , row , to set size.
+ And we can use padx , pady to set interval 
```
Ex: padx = 10 -> 10 <- x -> 10
    pady is same logic....
```
-------------
3.place
+ Can use relx , rely.
+ But the maximum length is 1 (0 ~ 1).
-------------
```
If we change the size , Place will be changed , But grid didn't.
```
